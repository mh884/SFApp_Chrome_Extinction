In 2017 Salesforce developer shows how to use a simple path to create Chrome extension [jaw-dropping extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4a81yB0nz0) using simple programming language by that time I was new into the salesforce platform ecosystem, Today we implement a new extension to solve complex use case's for our customer support team in SFApp.

SFApp have a powerful feature around rules to build condition queries in the Form that have no limitation of how many rules the form can have, Customer, can have more than 100 rules for complex use cases, adding to no limitation on rules some field's can get multiple rule's which my drag the overall rules to get a low loading performance in builder side, For that we implement Chrome extinction to show all the rules to allow the CX team a to solve customer issue,

SFApp extension main feature's

- Ability to show all saved rules for the rules inside the Form Page
- Ability to search for Rules based on condition field or value
- Ability to remove a rule
- Ability to write a rule using IF/Then custom statement (under development)
